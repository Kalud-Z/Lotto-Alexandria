Questions for your Mentor :

it takes me forever. to find a bug ! in my own code ! 
it got huge and complicated , what can I do to make the process of findin bugs super easy and fast ?

Lessons you have learnt :


NEVER write unnecessary code ! not because you want a Clean Code , but instead because you will never know when it will come back and bites you in the ass !
==> so always make sure , the methods are doinf EXCATLY what they supposed to do , no more no less. and the event listeners, are listenin to least amount of HTML elements as possible !.

Refactoring :

2)currently :

we call removeCoupon() , only when we click deleteAllFields in one coupon !.


===> what it should be: 
we call it when we click goBack (if fieldsChecked === 0)

and when we click goNextCoupon  (if fieldsChecked === 0))
