Lessons you have learnt :


NEVER write unnecessary code ! not because you want a Clean Code , but instead because you will never know when it will come back and bites you in the ass !
==> so always make sure , the methods are doinf EXCATLY what they supposed to do , no more no less. and the event listeners, are listenin to least amount of HTML elements as possible !.
